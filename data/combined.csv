Show them the difference between Cuba and Haiti, two very similar countries in terms of population, resources, geography etc. The only real difference is Cuba developed as a communist nation whereas Haiti is capitalist. They're about as good as we can get as comparible countries to see the difference between capitalism and communism. India and China are a good comparison too. Don't make the mistake of comparing every country to the USA or other western powers that built their wealth on slavery and imperialism. Remember most of these socialist countries were victims of imperialism, so its not a fair comparison. 

If you look through that link I posted you will see that Cuba is better than Haiti on pretty much every metric; GDP, healthcare, education, child mortality rate, life expectancy, acess to food and water, literacy, poverty, unemployment, beds per capita, maternal mortality rate etc etc

&gt; I have one question though, why wouldn't it be possible for a communist party to implement capitalist reforms (Doi Moi, NEP) while maintaining the proletarian character.

It is possible to an extent. Lenin and Mao were both very aware that concessions to the capitalist mode of production would result in the heightening of struggle (and further contradictions which would need to be overcome) and so they did not take the decision to implement [NEP](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1921/oct/17.htm) and [New Democracy](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-2/mswv2_26.htm)  (respectively) lightly. They each had their own justification for using capitalist production as a means to jump-start their countries socialist construction - each which were war-torn, backwards, the enemy of imperialists/bourgeoisie and *in their infancy*. Finally, each country moved past these periods, and this is the indicator which shows the proletarian character was able to maintain *majority* control in the end. In other words, we know from these historical facts that *it is* possible for a communist party to implement some *limited* capitalist reforms *for a given period of time* and still come out on top.

&gt; As you say capitalism was restored, but the socialist struggle continues in the party, isn't it a question of which side has won out?

There is a reason that Marxist analysis takes class struggle as the motor of history, and this is because it is rooted in scientific observation and further proven by historical events. Having observed these historical events we understand that class struggle continues under a socialist mode of production (China and the USSR prove this) and the communists must remain aware of it. It is not a question of which side has won out because neither are defeated; the state apparatus will be wielded by either class to repress the other, and the question of which class is being repressed is the main indicator of who is in charge (and thus whether socialism or capitalism is being pursued). As businessmen in China can continue to bring in billions of dollars while labour exploitation continues I can safely say that the proletarian side has not won out. Of course we view the world dialectically and understand that the proletarians and communists are struggling against this, and it will not be this way forever (indeed socialism will win), and this is all the more reason why we should see the world accurately. 

&gt; One can do a ""Marxist"" analysis of a thing but just because one does not use an idealistic, petty bourgeois... method doesn't mean you come to the right conclusions.

This is why one must be subject to self-criticism and in the presence of comrades who can measure ones analysis. It is further helpful that we have 150+ years of literature, events, observations and theory by which to measure our own analyses. Clearly, even a Marxist analysis that is *slightly* incorrect is preferable to one that can't even observe the world as it is, and as the OP shows it is possible to correct deviations in those with good intentions. If Marxism was actually false then there would be no reason for any of us to be communists.

Furthermore, there are advanced ways to take advantage of the  always-on nature of nuclear. You can use the steam generation from advanced reactors to create H2 (for fuel cells), which can be used to produce peaking power at high demand times, and can be diverted to storage for low-usage times. You can also use advanced nuclear reactors for process heat for many industrial processes that traditional light water reactors can't because they can generate higher temperatures.

During the colonial era a large chunk of Somali territory was handed over to the Ethiopian Empire. This region, commonly known as the Ogaden region or Somali region (I prefer the term Somali region as Ogaden is a Somali clan) was historically and remains land inhabited predominantly by ethnic Somalis. 

When Somalia gained it's independence, there was always this idea of Greater Somalia amongst Somali nationalists. This was incorporated into the Somali flag, which depicts a star with 5 points, each representing a region. The regions are the following: British Somaliland (Northern Somalia, present day Somaliland), Italian Somaliland (southern Somalia) present day Djibouti (old french Somaliland), Kenyan Somaliland (NFD), and the Somali region in Ethiopia (the Ogaden). In 1960, British and Italian Somaliland united to form the present day county of Somalia. 

After 9 years of democratic rule, a military coup occurred and Siad Barre, the general of the Somali army took over the country. He introduced what he called Quranic Marxism/Scientific Socialism. He became Somalia's longest serving president as a dictator from 1969-1991. His reign was ugly, but this isn't about that. 

Barre wanted to push this idea of Greater Somalia further and began supplying arms to Somali rebel groups in the Ogaden in Ethiopia for years. This came to a head in 1977, when the Somali army invaded Ethiopia to reclaim and liberate the Ogaden. Thus the Ogaden War began, and many point to this being the ultimate demise of Barre. The invasion occured shortly after the Derg took over Ethiopia in a coup. Ethiopia was at a weak point. 

Interestingly enough, Castro met with Barre and Mengistu (leader of the Derg) prior to the war to propose a United East African state between Somalia and Ethiopia. This was switftly rejected by Barre. 

When the Somalis began the invasion, they were initially successful. The captured most of the Ogaden. The Soviet Union, who were allied with both Somalia and Ethiopia, urged the Somalis not to continue the war. The Somalis refused, and thus the Soviet Union switched all support to Ethiopia. 

As the war continued, there was a consolidated effort among Soviet allies to aid the Ethiopians, who were getting pummeled by the Somalis. Cuban troops joined the effort, as well as Yemeni troops and a few other Soviet allies (can't remember top of my head). Castro was interestingly aiding imperialist Ethiopia, but this is another story for another day. 
With all the support the Ethiopians got, the tides of the war turned. The Somalis, after months of fierce fighting were pushed back and lost their gains. The war eventually ended in a Somali defeat. 

After the war, Somalia was in a terrible place economically. The country began to splinter, and many got fed up with Barre and his reign. Many uprisings began, most notably with the Isaaq clan in the north of Somalia. Barre vegan to crack down extremely harshly against opposition groups, and thanks to the Americans was aided with military support to do so. This culminated in the utter destruction of the city of Hargeisa in the north. In terms of a genocide, Somalis of all clans were brutally struck down, but it's clear the Isaaq got it the worst. Whether one wants to describe it as a genocide, that's up for conversation. 

I can get more into how communism worked in Somalia (hint it didn't). But I just wanted to touch on some of the events you touched on.

[],,some_random_commie,,,,,,[],"This article and the other one are quite refreshing. Long has it been that any talk of guerrilla warfare against the US government has basically been forbidden on *all* the English-language ""Left"" spaces, whether online or offline. Hopefully the powers that be don't get wind of what is taking place here! I mean, we are just talking about a game of Minecraft, right? ;-)

If I may offer my opinion, though, I think the overall plan is (somewhat) mistaken. The author of this piece speaks of establishing ""Red bases"" and ""dual power."" They also speak of gaining ""a large base of support,"" which requires limiting targets to ""only military and state targets.""

I would say this logic still sees the goal of the guerrilla war as the *eventual* overthrow of the current regime, to be replaced with a revolutionary communist government. But what if the goal is more limited, say, to simply make it *impossible* for US imperialism to continue to function at all?

If the plan doesn't (necessarily) include revolution as the end goal, but is primarily about throwing a wrench into the machinery of US imperialism, this changes tactical considerations a lot.

The most obvious thing this strategic change has is that there is no longer any need to capture any territory, no need for ""Red bases"" or forming structures of dual power on the ground. If the masses of ""America"" are largely reactionary anyway, as the article basically hints, there would be no purpose to even trying to establish political authority over any of the population, who would just oppose us anyway.

And once the parasitic nature of the overwhelming majority of the population is assumed, there is also *no reason* to limit targets to ""state actors."" When the State in question is a Leech State, the distinction between State and civilian largely disappears. The only question is *which* leeches are worth targeting, and which are not.

This may also be controversial to say, but if the end goal *isn't* communist revolution, there is also no real need to engage the state based on communist propaganda. That is to say, if you *disguise* your real motivations, you can potentially get the State to crack down on other sections of population, potentially even *forcing* other actors into violence against the State who might not otherwise be willing to engage in violence at the moment.

I myself would draw the line at *recruiting* based on other ideologies. This would create a huge logistical problem, as the US military itself no doubt realizes trying to maintain their Wahabi-contras as an effective fighting force. Recruitment of fighters should still be based on revolutionary anti-imperialism, because otherwise you would need entire fake organizations promoting crap you don't even believe in, to people who may or may not come to realize what your *actual* goals are.

But that doesn't mean actions can't be done, and *propaganda* videos made, that don't reflect the *real* underlying ideology at all. Not only does this serve the purpose of getting the State to attack the *wrong* targets in retaliation, and drawing other forces into combat with the State who otherwise might not be willing to fight them, it also makes recruitment easier. If the State thinks it is fighting Sovereign Citizens or some other white settler rebels to its Right, this means less resources spent sending in agents to revolutionary anti-imperialist organizations to disrupt their activities.",,,1600503437,{},g5sodsw,False,t3_ivkzyn,False,True,t3_ivkzyn,/r/communism/comments/ivkzyn/the_us_military_would_not_be_invincible_against/g5sodsw/,1600564736,50,True,False,communism,t5_2qolz,,0,[],[],text,t2_7qr0be50,False,False,,,1600505845.0,

All of their industry was destroyed, leaving no place to work, and the New Unified Government kicked them to the curb and wouldn’t offer them help.

A lot of East Germans only wanted just a little bit more expression from their State since they never fully did step away from being Big Brother with fears that the Nazis would return (with a quick glance over the wall, and who was being appointed to positions in the West, it was quite evident the Nazis had never left). But one thing lead to another and East Germany vaporized right in the air.

You might know Gary Gereffi and ""global value chain analysis"" since John Smith discusses it in his book but there's a decent center for it which has good empirical work

There's a good series on Korea. Also you might know Arrighi's work but there's a good work on steel, coal, and iron ore in the rise of Japan and China 

https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/east-asia-and-global-economy (all books can be found online)

The theory is nonsense but the empirical analysis is interesting, especially because it brings in Australia, South Africa, Brazil, and Canada into what is usually an America-Japan-China story.

Also you might already know Chalmers Johnson,Alice Amsden and Robert Wade as the East Asian ""developmental state"" people but there are two books I enjoy that are less known. One is 

https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9780312160562

Which brings Japan and Korea together (and by extension China on a much larger scale). The other is pure business literature and apologia for Korean nationalism but has some good information about the rise of Samsung which tells us a lot about Huawei

https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/tiger-technology/F03E7206B5333C361AE4DBDC0F8BC851

Sorry that these are mostly about Korea and Japan and none are Marxist. Some of that is my specialization is Korea and Japan, everything I read on China is for myself. Some of that is political, I honestly don't know of any good books on China, they are either ""Marxist"" works that interview random Chinese workers and how miserable they are or American bourgeois sociology that is nothing but junk theory about ""authoritarian capitalism"" or whatever. China does not have a national academic industry like Japan and Korea and what does exist is in Hong Kong and therefore is warped by politics. Of course there are good Marxist works but we already know them and by virtue of being Marxist they have to gloss over empirical specificities to talk about the totality, at least if the goal is to get under 500 pages.

Mali's President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta has been arrested by mutinying soldiers, a government spokesman has confirmed to the BBC.

Prime Minister Boubou Cissé has also been arrested, despite earlier appeals for ""brotherly dialogue"".

The apparent coup attempt in the West African nation began with gunfire at a key military camp near the capital, Bamako, on Tuesday morning.

In the city young men set a government-owned building on fire.

The arrest of President Keïta and his prime minister has sparked widespread international condemnation.

It came hours after disgruntled junior officers detained commanders and took control of the Kati camp, about 15km (nine miles) from Bamako.

The unrest coincides with calls for more protests to demand that the president resign.

**What do we know about the mutiny?**

It is led by Col Malick Diaw - deputy head of the Kati camp - and another commander, Gen Sadio Camara, BBC Afrique's Abdoul Ba in Bamako reports.

After taking over the camp, the mutineers marched on the capital, where they were cheered by crowds who had gathered to demand President Keïtas's resignation.

In the afternoon they stormed his residence and arrested the president and his prime minister - who were both there.

The number soldiers taking part in the mutiny is unclear - as are their demands. Some reports say it was fuelled by a pay dispute.

Kati camp was also the focus of a mutiny in 2012 by soldiers angry at the inability of the senior commanders to stop jihadists and Tuareg rebels taking control of northern Mali.

Footage from AFP news agency showed a building owned by the justice ministry in Bamako ablaze on Tuesday.

**Shades of 2012**

Analysis by Will Ross, BBC World Service Africa editor

What began as a mutiny appears to have morphed into a coup. This will be welcomed by the huge number of protesters who have been out on the streets for months calling for President Keïta to step down.

Parallels will be drawn between these events and 2012 when the government's mishandling of a rebellion led to another coup.

Violent jihadists took advantage of that chaos to seize northern Mali. And they continue to cause havoc across the region.

**Why is the president unpopular?**

https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/590/cpsprodpb/39C6/production/_114009741_gettyimages-1228091670.jpg

Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta won a second term in elections in 2018, but there is widespread anger over corruption, the mismanagement of the economy and the worsening security situation with jihadist and communal violence on the increase.

In recent months huge crowds led by populist imam Mahmoud Dicko have been calling on President Keïta to step down.

Much smaller crowds reportedly gathered in the capital on Tuesday in support of the soldiers.

**What has the reaction been?**

United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres demanded the ""unconditional release"" of Mali's leaders and the ""immediate restoration of constitutional order"".

The chairman of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, said he ""emphatically condemns"" the arrests of President Keïta and his prime minister.

The Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) said: ""This mutiny comes at a time when, for several months now, Ecowas has been taking initiatives and conducting mediation efforts with all the Malian parties.""

\#\#\#There's a video here that I can't link. It has text beneath it: Mahmoud Dicko has emerged as the leader of an opposition movement seeking the Malian president's departure 

Mali is a key base for French troops fighting Islamist insurgents across the Sahel region, and the former colonial was quick to react to Tuesday's events.

It's not a matter of difficulty but the way you approach knowledge which has been cultivated in you by the internet.

Thus one can read a ""debunking"" before reading the thing being debunked, and in fact this is preferable as such superficial and polemical approaches are the only way to take in the totality of knowledge as a flat surface given its vast scope and atemporality.

This is not an easy habit to break, not only because it is a cultivated feeling rather than a judgement, but because it corresponds to late capitalism itself and the very manner in which we reproduce our conditions of life. But the difficulty of breaking the habit is contrast with the obviousness of the solution: actually read things and follow their own logic without the expectation that you will understand the totality at every moment.

At best they might ascribe to a faux-Marxism taken from Piketty, but they're generally influenced by MMT, Keynesianism, under-consumptionist theory, etc. They solely look at the New Deal and see that as the beginning of their ideology and they generally ignore all evidence that the USSR was the left-alternative to capitalism which drove countries, especially Nordic ones, to the left as their capitalists were forced to make concessions via the left-ish governments. They don't seem very historically literate from what I've seen, usually they'll point to basics like wages and stuff throughout the decades but they just assume, much like Trumpers, that we can just fix everything by paying people more and ""bring the jobs back.""

If you want to read a little on the current state of the economy and how it fits into the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, Michael Roberts' blog recently published this and it does a good job showing how the economy never really recovered from the '90s dot.com bubble (let-alone the 2008 housing crisis).

Yeah, 100%. Especially with climate change where countries will either be forced to adhere to strict carbon budgets or the decimation of the third-world economies as mass starvation and natural disasters further erode imperialist states' ability to extract work and resources from them. The frontier for capitalism's expansion will shrink every decade.

&gt; Liberals use an a-historical lens when analyzing economic policy . . . 

Yeah. Pretty much always. Their complete lack of knowledge of the enclosure of the commons as part of capitalism's genesis, for instance.

&gt; The only solution they have is MMT to fund the state? Isn’t MMT related to future productive capacity and therefore the future ability to achieve profits, on a quarterly basis?

I don't think a large portion of reformers are MMTers. Some are MMTers because they see it as an easy way around class conflict because they believe they can constantly invest in the economy fast enough with government-backed funding to fund a welfare state where our access to resources is the only limit to production. Which could be true in the short term, but it's dependant on a democratic state that constantly watches all of the economy to cut away inefficiencies and inequalities forever.

The non-MMTers have a range of opinions, usually utopian ideals where wise/morally-conscious investment, technological development, slight reform of election systems, etc. are enough to fix things.

[],,SaintSeiya91,,,,,,[],"Excellent research comrade. It always amazes me how people think a famine within a country could target political opponents. Famines are indiscriminate of who they target and would be the most indeficiente way of targeting policial descent. 

If the national party wanted to curb Ukrainian nationalism, they would have sent the red army or NKVD, not “orchestrate” a famine. The burden of proof is on them to prove that the 1933 famine was planned. Given how the Soviet Union was a planned economy, it should be pretty easy to prove that the famine was planned right? Especially given the opening of the internal archives after the USSR dissolution. 

But no. They do not have any proof that the famine was  orchestrated. They only have testimonials of people who lived during it and/or Nazi propaganda trying to besmirch the union to the League of Nations. 

The evidence shows the contrary. It shows that the union was in crisis and tried everything to relieve the famine which was solved by 1934. An attempt of genocide would not have an internal relief effort to stop a famine nor would it do so this quickly.

I've used this one before, but in defense of the actually existing socialist systems of the world:

I actually think the conceptualization of the USSR by the West is the biggest lie. The notion of communism's 'failure' is largely one defined by western propaganda. The notion American mythmaking attempts to put into your head is that Russia was on par with Britain or America, went communist and then fell behind. This is an inversion of events - Russia was well behind, then 'went communist,' and then rapidly caught up. The idea sold that England and America were more or less on par with Russia in 1910 is a massive lie, Russia was a backwards mess by comparison.

1) Socialism has never been allowed to succeed (or fail) on its own merits, but only under the unending siege from imperialists, who will stop at nothing to see any and every socialist movement (with any real momentum behind it) in the world crushed: whether it be through direct invasions (as we saw in the Russian Civil War, when America, France, Britain, Germany and others all dropped what they were doing to invade the fledgling USSR, because a proletariat state even existing, is a very real challenge to their claims on power), assassinations, coups, blockades, embargoes, sabotage, extortion, contras, election-rigging, terrorism, kidnappings, and whatever other means are available to attempt to ruin, damage or destroy any effort to establish socialism anywhere on the planet. So socialists are forced to not only build socialism, but simultaneously fend off the most powerful empires in the world, endlessly, while trying to build socialism. This creates a rather nasty contradiction, where the only successful socialist states capable of holding territory for more than a few months are (forced to be) highly militarized. Socialism has never been left to be at peace.

2) For hundreds of millions of people - socialism has worked - remarkably. Paraphrasing Parenti here, but for hundreds of millions of humans, really existing socialist states have taken people whose material conditions were inadequate (lacking food, lacking shelter, lacking clean water, lacking (real) freedom, lacking medicine, lacking political power, lacking any sort of life with dignity) and elevated them to a place in which their conditions were adequate (where they had those things). That's an enormous achievement - among the most significant in human history - and it is endlessly downplayed or ignored, especially in the west, because our conditions have been abundant for as long as we've known (which is largely a result of plundering the third world to the bone), so to wealthy westerners, adequate seems like quite a step down - but for billions of people on the planet, adequate would be an enormous improvement.

3) Western media has endlessly filled its citizens heads with propaganda that communism is evil and has never worked and can only do bad (after all, the owners of said media have a rather significant investment in maintaining the status quo), and as such, will go to great lengths to suppress, downplay, or outright ignore the many achievements of communism. Cuba is among the world leaders in medical science. A tiny resource depleted island, under the largest and longest economic embargo in all of history, somehow achieves higher life expectancy and lower infant mortality than the United States. That's rather odd for such a failure of a system, no? The Soviet Union defeated Hitler and the Nazis - at extreme cost - and the west frequently downplays, misrepresents, or ignores the (decisive) Russian contribution to saving the world. Pol Pot's wicked regime (which the US still tried to recognize as legitimate for 10 years after it was toppled) met its end at the hand of the heroic Vietnamese communists, who had lost so much already defending their homeland from American invaders.

4) Touching on the previous point - compare Russia in 1910 to any of the capitalist cores at the same time. If you were to do a ""Global Power Rankings,"" 1910 Russia would not even make the Top 5. Compare the 1910 Russian economy to 1910 Britain or 1910 America - it wasn't industrialized, very little rail, ~20% literacy, totally dependent on agriculture, with massive institutions from feudalism still in place. You could easily say they were 75-80 years behind Britain or America. Then compare that to 1960s Russia. Unambiguously 2nd in any global power ranking, fully literate, fully industrialized, rail connecting much of the country, putting humans in space and one of the world leaders in science, full education and healthcare for its citizens, eliminated homelessness, and some of the most impressive economic output in human history. Compared to 1960's Britain or England, they were now only 30-40 years behind. Even compare 1990 Russia - they were inventing cell phones and Tetris, had the highest literacy rates in the world, and impressive GDP per capita that Russia wouldn't see again until the 2010s - they were only about 10-20 years behind America or Britain. They had almost completely caught up.

This is even where the whole etymology of first world, second world, third world comes from. Russia in the 1910s wasn't the first world, like England or Britain - they were not an advanced, developed economy. They were the third world. And then communism happened, and the conditions in Russia improved so much, so fast, that you could no longer call Russia the third world - they had to create a new status - the second world - for these countries who had closed the gap so significantly. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia fell behind again by at least a decade, and most of the country (outside the wealthier parts of Moscow or St. Petersburg) went right back to being the third world, where much of the country remains to this day.

5) Lastly, the notion that the capitalist countries of the world are the peaceful protectors, rather than the ruthless extractors, is demonstrably untrue, as the history of the 20th century show us. Both World War I and World War II stemmed from breakdowns in the capitalist system (the former being a collision of banking systems, the latter being a conflict of rival imperial powers vying for global supremacy). Capitalist countries have invaded almost every corner of the world to install capitalist regimes and overthrow those that even suggest alternatives. And despite all the Cold War hysteria, the Soviets were never the aggressor, and in fact, totally backed down rather than escalate any conflict to the point of nuclear war. History is very much on our side, and there is a reason that communism has spread to almost every country, almost every language, and remains a global political presence in all parts of the world to this day.",,,1595121988,{},fyinahy,False,t3_hts4y1,False,True,t3_hts4y1,/r/communism/comments/hts4y1/fight_with_parents_help_me/fyinahy/,1595228708,2,True,False,communism,t5_2qolz,,0,[],[],text,t2_3mcss,False,False,,,,

He didn't push socialism, he pushed the idea (which is at the root of social democratic thought) that our global dominance entitles us to greater luxuries for workers in the first world.   

He condemned and continues to condemn socialist leaders in Latin America, indeed he continues to renounce every socialist country in the world. Bernard is an imperialist, and had he succeeded it would have pacified voices of resistance. It would have put capitalism on life support and helped the US maintain its destruction of the third world for decades. The only people who were ""radicalized"" by Sanders were the supporters who realized the danger of social democracy. Social democracy is not a stepping stone towards socialism, it's a preservation of capitalism that legitimates the destruction of the global working class for greater comfort under western imperial power.  

Sanders didn't ""hold a blacklight"" to America's bedsheets. Do you think poor people needed a politician to tell us this shit was broken? The only thing he exposed is the unwillingness of Capital to concede an inch even to a moderate soc dem, it made it apparent that we'll get fascism before we get social democracy. Sanders defeat is a deathblow for democratic socialism - it made clear the stakes of the struggle and that violent revolution (which will certainly be led by colonized people, probably in Latin America) is the only path forward.

There are 2 things that bother me with liberal imperialists:

* 1) Always looking to fix issues in other people's countries instead of starting with their own / if they fail locally they will try elsewhere instead of pursuing it. And of course the sheer disproportionality that they dont realize that they are just pawns in the imperialist game. For example they are upset that there is poverty in North Korea (which they have caused) and then call for a regime change (which will kill and immiserate more people), but they have no problem with the 1/3 of US households who are poor as f. It's always obsessed with the ""liberation"" of non-whites, which bring me to...

* 2) Liberalism has an inherent imperialist outlook, which is entangled with white supremacism (since most of the world is non-white so, it must have racist elements to justify it further). The white-savior complex of trying to save ""barbarians"" from themselves with their ""superior"" white asses, because the ""barbarians"" are just too inferior to save themselves, then the world can just recognize how superior whites are because they just save so many people, I am not joking they are probably this delusional in their heads. And this is entangled with the entire ""liberal sentimentalist"" phenomena, where you have things like [We Are the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Are_the_World) bullshit, just virtue signalling empathy and make the colony dependent on western aid (which will probably be used for influencing) and charity, instead of you know empowering them and industrializing them like China does.

[],,RedMenace_10,,,,,,[],"I would say that I always was a Communist.   I wanted to live on an agrarian self sufficient commune.   However it wound up not believing in all Communist ideals.  I was called fascist because i was not a peacenik.   I fully think that the proletariat should be armed to defend the revolution and myself and brothers and sisters.   

Si vis pacem, para bellum

Fascist seems to be thrown around by everyone left of center that does not bow to their special interest group as supreme.  

If you think that religion is the opiate of the masses,  you are a fascist for “persecuting Muslims”

If you don’t really care about someones sexual identity, gender, personal thoughts on abortion you are labeled a fascist.

I don’t see how the Green Movement became communist as it does not actively work to set the people free from the boot of the government.   But for having apathy for that movement i have been called a fascist. 

I think that the Green Movement is just another way that the bourgeoisie are trying to exploit us by increasing the cost of goods in our current capitalist society.  

If you needed a truck to work your farm 30 years ago you could afford a solid truck with 4WD For less than the price of a car. If you need a truck now that has the capability to do the work you require expect to spend 50-100k with a vehicle weighed down with more superficial “luxury” than a palace.   

I don’t need a rolling palace that costs more than my house. I need something to haul tons of feed and equipment.   

If you have a chance to witness small farming communities in middle America,   You will see that the revolution is growing.   People are tired of being exploited i am going to break down examples these are just under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act

Monsanto makes seed that ruins heirloom seeds.   Even if you had a non GMO seed as the pollen travels on the wind it cross pollenates the seed that you grew from stock you saved from previous years.   Then Monsanto sends squads to steal plants for “testing” in the dead of night.   If your crops have been tainted then you will be sued and loose in their courts enforcing laws passed by their government bought by the labor of the farmers they destroy.  

John Deere makes it impossible for a farmer to repair their own equipment now.   Even if you figure out what sensor needs to be replaced a “Dealer” will have to make a service call to initialize it using software that is illegal for the farmer to have as it breaks the licence agreement when the tractor is sold.

If you can somehow eek out a living then you are at risk from the 4 meat packing corporate masters artificially lowering the prices paid to the farmer or eliminating them completely for cheaper imports from Brazil and south american countries raised illegally on stolen rainforest land.   

If you are a dairy farmer,  it is illegal for you to sell or even give away your milk outside of a corporate plant that will import milk from outside the supposed CO-OP and tell you to destroy your production simply to increase their profits.      

So now you see how our farming brothers and sisters are being exploited by their corporate masters.   And when they oppose more regulations and laws that only generate more capital for the bourgeoise.   But because they are perceived by the wanna be ruling class, as hicks and rednecks they must be fascists for begging for scraps from the right center.

There are no allies or revolutionaries in the government.   There are only masters and want to be masters.  Every one of our laws only benefit the ogliarch states of america.

I actually think that this Virus and Trump are great for the revolution.  It gets the masters fighting each other exposing the wanna be dictators the ogliarchs and showing how capitalism has failed the worker.   

Unions are growing in numbers albeit slowly as corporations are slashing wages to boost failing profit margins.

The article mentions that they also had no standard form of currency, and that their wealth was more or less measured in agricultural surplus, but even so they still possessed noble elites and aristocrats who could own private property and have their descendents inherit it. I'll have to go back in and reread to verify this, but I believe the article also alluded to them possessing slave laborers.

A Marxist state wouldn't possess class disparities like the ones that existed in the Incan Empire. And if I'm not mistaken the fact that the Inca possessed an empire in the first place alludes to their history of conquering and subjugating neighboring states and communities in an imperialistic manner.

That is your right but it is outside the realm of logic, simply treat the work like you would any other and you will be able to evaluate it like any other. People have no idea how difficult a metacritique of another work actually is (ironically that's what most of Furr's work is), it takes an entire other book and at least as much research as a doctorate.

That's fine but the standards of Bayesian logic are as rigorous as criticizing a single work, possibly moreso. The problem is simply that you want your cake and to eat it too.

I want to know if the sources he used are. I do not wish for metacritique or a doctoral response, I just wish for a critique of his sources from someone who has investigated them, without a bias toward communism at large. If that doesn't exist, then I can resign myself to it and perhaps at some point get around to investigating Furr's bibliography myself...I'm just lazy and hopeful that a comrade out there has sought fair critique in Furr's work previously, or hopeful that comrades on here don't merely like a work for saying things that confirm a bias.

I'm already to a point today where I've pretty much resigned myself to permanent ignorance on the centuries-past ""true events"" of a state no longer extant. I'm realizing that it's foolish to wish for a ""perfect book"" to read, where critique and response are developed to a point of intellectual ""comfort"". I'm realizing that with such a comprehensive intellectual and political apparatus against Marxism-Leninism, there are some narratives that just are best unilaterally opposed by MLs, even if ""true history"" lies beyond an ML's capabilities of observation.

But this post wasn't really about that, it was me just being intellectually guarded about claims Furr makes, seeking either confirmation that some of his claims are dubious and should be treated with skepticism or confirmation that anti-communists are exaggerating a perceived hackery.

I dont know what Bayesian means, but yeah I do want to be careful about how much investment I put in Furr's claims as I read his work, so that I dont risk dogmatism. I don't really know about what ur saying with the ""militancy vs. scholastics"" thing...I think that Lenin and Marxist theory is pretty well supported by objective, material realities which required a lot of intellectual investigation on Lenin's and Marx's part.

[],,Amazaline,,,,,,[],"I will GLADLY inform on this. Michigan is like a lot of states in the US. A couple of big cities, but mostly rural. The east side of the state was hit hard by COVID-19, in relation to having the biggest city (Detroit) and many people of color living in poor, crowded infrastructure. The West side has not been hit hard...yet. I'm expecting it to because of it's proximity to Chicago and the penchants of those residents to STILL come here to vacation in this mess.  

Now, why are people protesting? There is an executive order that went in place not allowing the sale of paint, seeds, and other non-essential items at stores great than 50,000 sq ft. You can still buy these things at smaller stores, but the governor wanted to stop people from browsing when they're bored. The executive order also stated that you couldn't go on the lake in a motor boat or travel to your vacation home (these things could spread the virus by increased use of gas and of course, travel). Lastly, the governor banned landscaping companies for now (that one I'm not so sure I agree with). 

There are some people who believe the virus is a hoax because there aren't as many cases outside of the Detroit area. There are some petty bourgeousie whose businesses are not allowed to operate (e.g. landscaping). There are some people who just want to do the opposite of what they're told because ""freedom."" If they had ever gardened in their lives, they would know only cold weather stuff like lettuce and peas can be planted right now, and if they wanted to start tomato and pepper plants inside, they should have done it weeks ago. These are the people who were protesting at the capital. The gridlock didn't allow workers or ambulances to get into a Level 1 trauma center - what heroes! 

People believe that the ability to consume and move around are the most inherent freedoms they can have. I didn't see them protesting about the EARN IT ACT. I didn't see them protesting when the previous governor poisoned a bunch of people in Flint with the water supply. I didn't see them protesting when that same previous governor sold public radio equipment and overrode elected officials via ""Emergency Financial Managers.""

An image of a text document. 

The title, written in bold, black capital letters, reads: “Socialist Appeal.” A red, five-pointed star appears between “Socialist” and “Appeal.”

The subtitle, written in bold, red capital letters, reads: “Coronavirus: Make the bosses pay!”

The bullet-pointed list of demands, written in black, beneath, reads:

\- “Reverse all privatisation and outsourcing in the NHS, and bring services completely back in house. Nationalise social care and private health.

\- The big pharmaceutical corporations must be nationalised to stop CEOs and shareholders profiteering from the pandemic.

\- End to zero-hour contracts and ‘bogus self-employment’ immediately.

\- Guaranteed sick pay and unlimited sick leave for all, including parents and carers having to look after those affected by school closures etc. 

\- Pause all non-essential production to prevent the spread of the disease, with workers guaranteed full pay as long as businesses are closed. 

\- End all public sector outsourcing.

\- Unions must demand proper health and safety measures in the workplace for those required to go in, with costs borne by companies. If bosses claim the money isn’t there, they should open the books to prove it.

\- Such steps should be discussed and decided by the workers themselves. If union presence is weak or nonexistent, this is the opportunity to begin organising and demanding trade union recognition. 

\- Nationalise the banks to direct resources to where they are needed.

\- No evictions of tenants. Requisition empty homes used for speculation by the super-rich to provide accommodation for the homeless.

\- Industries facing bankruptcy should be nationalised to protect workers’ jobs and livelihoods. The idle wealth of monopolies should be expropriated to fund the emergency measures required.”

The two paragraphs at the bottom of the document read: “With such steps, society could prevent the worst impacts of the pandemic and ensure that workers, the poor, and the vulnerable are not made to pay for the coronavirus crisis. 

Capitalism is a sick system. It cannot be patched up. Only clear socialist policies can provide a cure.”",,,1584557918,{},fkuxdph,True,t3_fkuq5s,False,True,t3_fkuq5s,/r/communism/comments/fkuq5s/demand_not_beg_via_socialist_appeal_international/fkuxdph/,1584562428,1,True,False,communism,t5_2qolz,,0,,[],text,t2_bie2wfy,False,False,,,,

If you really research Socialism where it has been tried, it isn't this state owned hellhole like US corporate owned media would tell you. In the USSR for example, co-ops dominated many industries, most prominently agriculture but all industries had at least 40% co-op presence.

Here's the [official statement from the Chinese embassy in the US](http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/fyrth/t1757162.htm).

&gt;  in February 2020, it designated five Chinese media entities in the US as ""foreign missions"" and imposed a cap on the number of their employees, in effect expelling Chinese journalists from the US. Such outrageous treatment prompted strong representations from China, in which China firmly objected to and strongly condemned the US move, and stressed its reserved right to respond and take actions. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Second, in response to the US slashing the staff size of Chinese media outlets in the US, which is expulsion in all but name, China demands that journalists of US citizenship working with the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post whose press credentials are due to expire before the end of 2020 notify the Department of Information of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs within four calendar days starting from today and hand back their press cards within ten calendar days. They will not be allowed to continue working as journalists in the People's Republic of China, including its Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions.

&gt; There are also some regimes, such as present-day capitalist China, which must be considered to be a relative “soft” form of fascism as compared with Germany and Italy in the 1930s. There are of course very tight laws restricting the democratic rights of the masses, including the working class, as well as constant attempts to imbue them with the ruling class‟s ideology. But for the most part the workers and masses are left pretty much alone to think as they wish until they actually protest publicly or try to change society in their own interests. Nevertheless contemporary China is a clear example of fascism, as far as the basic Marxist conception is concerned. Revolutionaries are arrested and imprisoned, and sometimes tortured or executed, and no revolutionary organizations or publications are allowed. Moreover, it would still be fascism there even if the bourgeois rulers were to allow contested elections (as they sometimes already do on the local level), as long as the democratic rights of free speech, a free press, assembly, protest, and organization among the workers and peasants to advance their own interests were still prohibited

&gt;The fact is that the revisionist Soviet Union was a fascist
and imperialist country, and we should not only admit this, we should insist on it. On our MLM conception of fascism, for example, there is just no doubt whatsoever about it. 

&gt;The United States is not a fascist country, though there have been periods when it has moved in that direction and at least one brief period when it came quite close

This is actually has humorous implications that someone who claims to be MLM actually believes the U.S. was and is more democratic than both the Soviet Union and modern day China. Isn’t this the same argument actual fascists and liberals of all flavor have made for both countries for literally decades? This just reeks of the “Three Worlds Theory” trash that Mao, Deng, and the CPC were pushing decades ago. The same thing that most, if not all, actually maoists have distanced themselves from. Most maoists i’ve seen on this sub, I’D BELIEVE, don’t uphold this line at all and believe both China AND the U.S. are capitalist powers, and some even say imperialist for both too. I’m not really agreeing with that line, but this makes so much more sense than this weird and flat-out incorrect line. It’s the same line that aligned China with imperialist interests! 

They, along with various other maoist groups, don’t even specify with the cases their proposing of support for clearly bourgeoisie movements. For instance, the Hong Kong protests being worthy of (albeit, critical) support of the Communist Party of the Philippines is suspect because of the class nature of these protests, as well as the fact they said they supported them as long as there was “no foreign interference.” This is quite perplexing for anyone who has been paying attention to the protesters literally setting people on fire, harassing women, and burning down hospitals and clinics while trying to contain the new outbreak. Supposedly, they believe there are a few people trying to advocate for more revolutionary activities. But this sounds like the same bullshit from people who didn’t support the intervention in the Hungarian uprising. For them, the REAL communists were fighting against the soviet union, while they purposefully let fascists out of jails and assault and kill jews. I’m making this point because the author mentions China “jailing revolutionaries.” What revolutionaries specifically? Who knows! They don’t specify: 

&gt;Revolutionaries are arrested and imprisoned, and sometimes tortured or executed, and no revolutionary organizations or publications are allowed. Moreover, it would still be fascism there even if the bourgeois rulers were to allow contested elections (as they sometimes already do on the local level), as long as the democratic rights of free speech, a free press, assembly, protest, and organization among the workers and peasants to advance their own interests were still prohibited.

That second part is all the more confusing because this is starting to sound more like an Op-ed from the Washington Post than a write-up from a maoist. They don’t specify on who they mean to be “revolutionary,” what specific incidents they mention that don’t come from some phony source in the NYT, and they do not offer much explanations for what kind of freedoms they’re truly talking about - bourgeois or proletarian. It more sounds like their preference is for a “bourgeoisie democracy” to be in place over their definition of “fascism.” What a seriously bizarre take from any communist. 

And it just keep getting even more confusing as to what the hell they actually stand for! It reads like a manic trotskyist who’s really fond of Mao made a late-night write-up over the weekend and had it edited by a CIA agent. It’s no question that the imperialists will take advantage of ANY POSITION people have on China, Russia, the Soviet Union, or anything within the communist movement and try to further divisions. This is why many communists talk about “critical support,” especially in the face of imperialist fascism, which this author outright denies or simply left out that the U.S. is taking part of. Maoists kind of do this when they support the MLMs in Turkey aligning with the PKK, but also (confusingly) support Rojava along with them. It isn’t just the Red Guards either (i’m not sure if they ever retracted their statements for what they believed and did). MIMprisons rejects Rojava like any reasonable communist should do, but seeing many more maoists support Rojava has made me wonder if they’re in minority here. It’s also bizarre that maoists are more willing to make allies of anarchists than non-maoist MLs that are still carrying out revolutionary actions, like the FARC, the PFLP, the KKE, etc. So many maoists come off more like separatists like trotskyists rather than anything particularly constructive. But, I wouldn’t argue that maoists aren’t doing anything - the NPA, Naxalites, and many other groups are doing much more than many of the sorry excuses for “communist” parties over here in the west. I’d seriously hope that they wouldn’t uphold this trash because that would seriously make me question the actual class they’re representing here, among some of the other polemics they’ve put out. My point is, don’t bash just “maoists” just because of shit like this. There are far more serious and correct MLMs than this writer. Plus, this write-up is also very old and may not reflect the same opinions of many other maoists today.

yes in the sense that's its the only last real bastion of Marxism, in the sense of the maxim of ""it is right to rebel"". Let's be honest, all of the other amerikkkan marxists believe ""it is wrong to rebel""

Otherwise, no, trotskyite cliques, including ""marxist-leninists"" that are really trotskyites, are much more numerous. 

""Marxist-Leninists"" that are not in a ""Marxist-Leninist"" party, quite literally do not count. 

&gt; if so, why do you think that is? 

see above, mostly. if you want to rebel, then Maoism is the only path.

&gt; I'm very interested in knowing more about how comrades use Mao's ideas in their understanding of the very center of capitalism.

In English syntax its easy to believe the word ""Maoism"" simply means ""relating to Mao"" but we must insist that its much beyond that.

Americans are very skeptical of going to war in the future.

However, understanding of the real nature of those wars is not very high at all. Most people believe that while we shouldn't have gone to war in Iraq and other places, that the governments we were fighting against were truly as bad as we were told. They believe all the propaganda about them. There's also a lot of ignorance as to the full economic reasoning for wars.

[],,ConsciousBook,,,,,,[],"There were prominent communist forces in Poland, and the Polish communists were literally the only ones that the Jewish population in in Poland could count on as an ally. The other Polish partisan forces - the Armia Krajowa and the National Armed Forces - were made up of large numbers of scoundrels drowning in anti-communism and anti-Semitism, and they literally had the blood of Russians, Ukrainians, Jews and Polish progressives on their hands.

&gt; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40403812?seq=1](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40403812?seq=1)   
&gt;  
&gt;During World War II, the most reliable allies of the Jews were Polish communists and the Soviet Union. Polish communists consistently condemned antisemitism, and even had a Jewish leader during the war, Pawel Finder. In virtually every ghetto resistance organization or Jewish partisan unit, communists had leadership positions and these formations received aid from the Soviet Union whenever possible  
&gt;  
&gt;The Home Army's attitude toward Jewish partisans was one of virulent antisemitism. It was virtually impossible for Polish Jews to join the Home Army. As the number of Jews escaping the ghettos and labor camps grew, Jews began to form their own partisan units. The Home Army considered these units to be subversive and characterized them as bandits. General Bor-Komorowski issued a directive in August 1943 which ordered Home Army units to take armed action against them and to liquidate their leaders. Dan Kurzman (1976) notes that this directive was enthusiastically taken up by field units, which attacked Jewish resistance units whenever possible, especially by the overtly antisemitic National Armed Forces (NSZ) . Not only did the Home Army command refuse to condemn these actions, it began to combine forces with the NSZ in recognition of ""their moral values and military achievement.

Polish nationalist propaganda, regurgitated by British+American mass media and some academia, slanders the Soviet Army by claiming that while it was battling the Germans in Poland, the Soviet Army deliberately stopped outside of Warsaw in order to let the Germans defeat the Warsaw Uprising, which is absolutely false. The Germans successfully pushed back the Soviet Army in the lead-up to the Warsaw Uprising. The Polish Home Army started the uprising purely for political reasons, as they wanted to consolidate control over Warsaw and prevent the formation of a socialist government.

&gt;In 1944, the Home Army ""two-enemy"" directive ordered its troops to refrain from fighting the Nazis so that they could inflict as much damage as possible on the invading Red Army. The Home Army command also believed that they had to lead the liberation of Warsaw to remain a credible political force. Since it was too weak to be successful on its own, the command hoped to time the revolt when the Red Army would be so near to Warsaw that it would be able to ""buttress our success,"" by its entry into the city. Without any communication, however, the Home Army was forced to guess when the Red Army was about to enter Warsaw.  
&gt;  
&gt;When he received an unsubstantiated report that the Red Army was successfully entering the outskirts of Warsaw on July 31, Bor-Komorowski issued the order to begin the Rising at 5 p.m. the next day. Despite further information that evening that the Germans had repelled the Red Army's advance well outside Warsaw, Bor-Komorowski refused to rescind his order. The Rising went badly as the German counteroffensive successfully pushed back the Red Army. Since the entire revolt had hinged on Red Army support against a collapsing German army, no provisions were made for prolonged fighting. Moreover, Friedman (1957, 124) reports that when Jewish partisans joined the struggle they were shot by Home Army detachments. As a result, the Nazis were able to destroy Warsaw, killing over 200,000 Poles and dispersing another 800,000 refugees. Despite this preponderance of evidence, **Cold War politics successfully promoted the view that the Red Army could have entered Warsaw but chose not to in order to allow the Nazis to destroy the heroic Home Army fighters**",,,1579383123,{},feu4wih,False,t3_eq0bms,False,True,t3_eq0bms,/r/communism/comments/eq0bms/poland_shamefully_blurs_the_lines_between_fascism/feu4wih/,1579389076,2,True,False,communism,t5_2qolz,,0,,[],text,t2_45pji3gr,False,False,,,,[]

[],,ConsciousBook,,,,,,[],"Polish nationalist trolling on the internet has a sinister and systematic character. It's hard to say whether Polish government-linked elements are responsible or whether it's a voluntary campaign. In the English language, discussions about Poland always seem to have the promotion of this violent, right-wing nationalism. But interestingly, in the Polish language, discussion about Poland seems to be more moderate: there are left-wing views on display and positive assessments about the People's Republic of Poland.

I'd have to say that from my observations, the ugliest and most vile nationalism I've seen online originating from outside of the United States would have to be Polish nationalist trolling about World War II, Russia, Ukrainians, and particularly about Polish collaboration with Germany. Turkish nationalist trolling about Kurds, Greece and Armenia is just as disgusting. And equally vile is pro-Israel trolling about Palestinians and other Arabs. Despite all the cries about ""muh Russian trolls"", I've noticed that pro-Russian viewpoints are scarce in the English-speaking realm. There's infinitely more pro-Soviet and pro-Russian sentiment on the Russian web, as Russians are mostly a monolingual nation and don't speak much English.

Here are Polish nationalist blowhards hijacking a discussion about Polish collaboration with the Nazis.

[],,transpangeek,,,,,,[],"I agree with Robot_Porkchop, but Christianity and most religions became an accessory to state control when society began organizing into more complex civilizations. There is plenty of good advice in the bible (particularly the new testament), but let’s not forget some of the barbarism some of the writers of the book condoned, including stoning of prostitutes, slavery, beating your children, incest, and of course, obeying the rules of law and state you live under. Most (conservative) christians don’t support most of those things i said anymore, and most jews don’t either. However, many love to fetishize the capitalist state and portray it as something of glory or anointed by god. In socialist states where religions are “oppressed,” they are considered reactionary, not only because they are conservatives, but because they advocate for further privatization. Because to them &amp; the west, christianity and capitalism are practically synonymous, as if they signify “freedom.” This mostly applies to America, of course.

During the early days of imperialism, religion was also used as a tool to control, convert, and manipulate the masses, and still kind of happens today via “missions trips.” They use it as if they’re saving people from their “barbaric” or “pagan” cultures. It’s also what led to the Boxer Rebellion in China. 

Now, not everyone who is religious is for capitalism, as liberation theology is a major driver in Latin America, and there were and are many communist muslim, christian, &amp; jewish people out there.

&gt;Best post in the sub. Thanks, OP. I post in here to agitate others to look into socialism. The ruling class definitely conspires, the problem is that people don't know how to theorize soundly on conspiracy.

&gt;For example, the idea of a ""deep state"" is only necessary in the absence of a Marxist concept like ""dictatorship of the bourgeoisie"". ""Deep state"" pretends to be a scientific-like term, but it's a liberal (bourgeois) mystification. It can point to the same problems and symptoms of capitalism like its Marxist counterpart, but it can't explain *why* the State serves the interests of the powerful. It'll always point to some moral failing or some neutered idea of ""greedy bankers"", rather than follow its conclusions from the logic of capital accumulation itself. For Marxists, the State developed as the highest expression of class struggle, the domination of one class over the other – the landlord over the peasant, and the capitalist over the wage labourer.

&gt;Right-wingers took over talk radio, public forums, and the far Left retreated into the University, surrendering the field of conspiracy theories (or as I prefer to call it, analysis of ruling class covert action) to the Right, turning it into a gateway for vaguely class conscious workers into reactionary politics and fascism.",,,1576710729,{},fbbxqnu,True,t3_eck9op,False,True,t3_eck9op,/r/communism/comments/eck9op/95_of_conspiracy_theories_are_just_critiques_of/fbbxqnu/,1576710730,1,True,False,communism,t5_2qolz,,0,,[],text,t2_xzjj6,False,False,,,,[]

It allows for the both employee and the employer to try to make the best deal for themselves. You want to get the highest wage you can get and they try to get the cheapest employee they can find within reason of course. It allows for people to produce and sell how they themselves see fit.

I think the greatest economic error that socialists in general make is you forget that the economy has two aspect, both money and also products, it is your ability to buy cheap products which makes you rich. So capitalism is so good because the producers are also free, so they want to produce and make money, this floods the market with products and everything is so cheap its insane because under capitalism there is no planned economy so we get market prices based on what people want to buy and pay for products, and also based on how  much that there is of that product or even resource so we dont waste scarce resources on bad ideas.

The most common thing i hear is that the workers dont own the means of production, that is true the company does the company paid for those things, those things that makes you extremly productive so you can even ask for a raise and get one.

The largest problem we have today is that a lot of opportunity has been throw away because politicians wants safety. This is actually not very good sure you are safer in the job you have but you also have less opportunity and you lost another safety which might have been more important then the one you got. The safety that you can find a job today pretty much whereever. That way losing your job isnt dangerous, you can walk out of the company you work for and start working in the store next door. That way you dont have to be afraid at all to demand things from your boss, ask for a raise that you dont even deserve yet isnt a dangerous proposition because there are jobs everywhere.

You often here stories from the past how people just moved around and worked a little here and there, that was because it was so easy to get a job, you could take a train with almost no posessions and go to a town you had never been in find a job the same day and a place to sleep the day after that. Jobs where everywhere, big notices in the papers ""come to the ford factory"" etc etc. Signs in windows ""store clerk needed"" ""hairdresser needed"" ""strong guy wanted"" ""can you speak french we have a job for you"".

That was the safety we lost, when we gave people more secure jobs. So now there is another safety that you dont have anymore, but in return you get to keep the job you find usually, but not really the same rules which applied back then still applies today, you have to be able to do your job.

Capitalism places the employee and the employer at the same level, they have the same rights and the same obligations to fulfill their part of the contract. You can quit whenever you want to, and they can also fire you whenever they want to but then we came up with this idiot rules that it the workers needed safety so that the evil employers couldnt just fire them, in return they are very careful with whom they hire so its a lot harder to find a job because its so hard to get rid of an employee that doesnt do his job very well.

There is always a tradeoff when you make laws concerning the employer and the employee because they will start acting in different ways based on what is best for them.

There were several other models that expanded upon Solow, but the establishment that capital begets production enhances has not been disproven yet. Add to that the invisible hand that basically says when profits are the driver, technology advances as well as the average quality of life for all population in an economy. Basically the driver for technological advancement and productivity are the pursuit of profits, and taking away incentives for profits kneecaps an economy, which as been supported in a number of publications.

**Part I:**

Most people do not understand what capitalism is from a fundamental perspective. Think about the foundation of a house -- it is the basis for the house itself. There are walls, floors, a kitchen, bathrooms, plumbing, electric work, maybe a second floor, etc. These are the pieces that comprise what you can do once you have the foundation. You get to *choose* to build a garage, or an office, or to have one or two bathrooms, or maybe a walk-in closet or two.

Capitalism is actually *extremely* simple. Capitalism and the free market are one and the same -- they are literal synonyms, in a manner of speaking. Just look at the dictionary definition of capitalism -- they all have one primary thing in common: *private ownership*.

Private ownership is a synonym simply meaning that you have ownership over your own property. This can be digital property, physical property, buildings, land, money, etc.

The foundation that I'm talking about here is really just that: owning your own property.

You see, the foundations of both socialism and communism when it comes to economics is the same. In fact, even fascism is a synonym here when you look at its foundation from an economic perspective. Just look at virtually any definition of these three words in nearly any major dictionary. For an example of each, for instance:

**Socialism:**

*a political and* ***economic theory*** *of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be* ***owned or regulated by the community*** *as a whole.*

**Communism:**

*a political theory derived from Karl Marx, advocating class war and leading to a society in which* ***all property is publicly owned*** *and each person works and is paid according to their abilities and needs.*

**Fascism:**

*Fascism is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power,* ***forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation*** *of society and* ***of the economy*** *which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.*

Note the regions of each definition of which I've **emboldened**. Socialism advocates that something, whatever we want to define that something as, is owned not by the individual, but by some form of group. Communism too as we can see, advocates that something, in this particular case, property, is owned by not the individual, but by some kind of group. Even fascism we can see here, within an economic sense, is noted to be defined in how the economy is regimented/controlled (by a group).

You see, these overarching definitions confuse the average layperson, because it's too simple for us to automate thoughts we might read, such as verbiage like, community, public, means of production, and property. The definitions of these words are often not fully flushed out. It's very crafty wordsmithing to use very ambiguous language like this.

For instance, what is the community of which the definition of socialism is trying to define that the means of production, distribution, and exchange are to be owned? In fact, what does it mean to have ownership over something?

Can two people have ownership without consent from both individuals? Well, no, actually, that's impossible. I go back to my question just above: what does it mean to have ownership over something? If you have ownership, you have two things: autonomy over that thing, and responsibility over that thing. There is no alternative here.

For example, if I own my car, you cannot use my car without my consent. This is a perfectly rational and sensible claim. In fact, there quite literally is no alternative here. Even if you were to attempt some form of society in which there were no overarching laws that were enforced by some societal central group, then individuals would just protect their own property through violence. There would be no ""laws"" to speak of from a centralized authority, meaning either a centralized authority would arise, such as the people in a neighborhood banding together to set rules and guidelines and as that community grew, outlining who would carry out what kinds of policing, judication, and punishment for transgressing those guidelines, and/or individuals would just protect themselves and their property. It's really that simple.

So back to the car. I can loan my car out to you, but if I didn't consent and you took my car, even if just to go for a quick drive with every intent on brining it back, you've subsequently stolen my car. In fact, today, if you were to take a car out for a joyride, even if you brought it back without a scratch and a full tank of gas, that would still be classified as theft, and the automobile owner in this case could press charges.

Understand that ownership has defining characteristics. You see, it also has to because there is no alternative. In order for both theft and charity to exist, you must have strict characteristics for ownership. After all, it isn't theft if nobody owns it, and I cannot give away that of which I do not own. This is why when the authorities confiscate stolen goods -- even if you paid for them -- you typically do not get refunded, even if you didn't know they were stolen.

Some characteristics of ownership are:

* Possession on ones person does not define it.
* Transferal of ownership requires consent from the original owner and potential new owner.
* You do not need to utilize an item to own it.

Those are just a few requirements of ownership. So for example, I could buy a picture and hang it on the wall of a house I don't visit for the next 2 years. I still own that picture, even if it is neither on me, nor if I gain no utility from it (I am not even enjoying it).

Additionally, transferring ownership must require consent. I cannot just show up with an old beat up car and leave it in your driveway, giving you all responsibilities of that automobile because I ""gifted"" it to you. You have to agree to ownership of that car, because in agreeing with it, you then are saddled with all responsibilities over that of which you own.

There's almost no way for more than one person to have ownership over a thing, you see.

Imagine that a small community of 10 people tried to own a single lawn mower. Let's say that Jack wants to use it on Monday, but so does Susan. Now if they can both consent 100% of the time on who gets to use it, that would be fine, but the likelihood that that will happen decreases as the number of people who own something increases. By the time you get to even 10 people, that likelihood is probably already completely gone.

So remember that the cardinal rule of ownership: YOU have autonomy over that of which you own. This means only you can decide what to do with something that you own. I cannot choose for you to have something you own destroyed, that would be destroying your property and we MUST stop others from destroying the property of others. We cannot let other people make utility of that in which you own, otherwise people will just take and use anything they like, often with disregard for its upkeep, maintenance, etc.

So if both Jack and Susan here both want to use the lawn mower Monday and neither will back down from that desire, how do you resolve that conflict? Well here's the thing: *No matter how you resolve it, the true owner of that lawn mower is whoever has the final say in who gets to use it*. Why? Because the owner of a thing has autonomy over said thing.

When I own my own lawn mower, I can LET you borrow it with MY consent. If you try to take that mower from me and use it in a manner I did not consent to, you are stealing my property. Also understand that theft doesn't simply mean someone took something from you, because what does that even mean, to take something from you? To take something from your person? What if you didn't have it on your person? To remove it from your proximity? I mean, you could just as easily leave your wallet at my house and I could take it to bring it back to you, or maybe I just pick it up to move it from the kitchen table to the closet so it didn't get ruined or lost. Did I steal it during the period of time in which I moved it? Of course not. But if I take your wallet and make use of it -- maybe I put MY cards and cash in it and use it as if it were MY wallet for a few months and then give it back (or never give it back), I have stolen it. I even stole it if I give it back eventually. So you see, theft also has rules, or it isn't theft. Theft, ownership, and charity all cannot have the same rules, otherwise you're running into very real and impossible to resolve logical issues in what these things actually mean.

So again, if Jack and Susan are arguing over who gets to use this lawn mower, but Joe resolves it by TELLING which one of them gets to use it, then Joe OWNS that lawn mower. Joe is granting PERMISSION to use that lawn mower to one of them. He's lending it to them. You see?

Even if you did it through some form of vote or council, it still means you are not the owner of that item unless your will were carried out. For example, if Jack wanted to use that mower Monday and he got a vote and his vote was for HIM to use it Monday and he was part of the majority vote, then HE owns that lawn mower this time around, but the moment that he votes in a manner in which what he wants to happen to that item doesn't happen, then he no longer owns that item.

There's actually no alternative. This is an actual unequivocal reality of ownership. It has to be this way, otherwise you're not actually talking about what ownership IS, but about some subjective arbitration of what you're trying to say ownership is, all the while unable to resolve logic errors in how you quantify the idea of ownership vs. say, theft.

When you do that, you open up the entirety of all of these ideas to be entirely malleable. Suddenly you can do whatever you want if you're in power, because you can just set the arbitrary definitions of things like theft and ownership. Nothing you do is ever immoral if you can take autonomy of things away from people and have that not be defined as theft. Additionally at that point, you're also just making stuff up, which is a problem in itself.

There's a lot more to it than this, but realize that these ""economic isms"" are all pointing to the same idea: That someone other than you owns what is yours.

Making investments is risky and a lot people much prefer the consistency and low downside risk of wage labour. In fact a lot those on the left say it's unfair that companies now are pushing contract work (a form of self ownership) over stable salaried employment.

[],,DJSalTNutz31,,,,,,[],"It's a very flawed idea that ignores other systems advances. The idea is that socialism has a vastly greater ability to focus resources into an idea that a company doesn't. Then combined with the fact that companies exist to make money, R&amp;D becomes prohibitive to the profit motive. It's more profitable to take innovation that has been invented and paid for by another because the investment is so minor compared to the innovator. So the innovator is essentially a sucker who over invested to improve the productivity of the market.

The example I always see used is the USSR space program. When the government decided that rocket and missile technology was important, they could pour massive investment into these technologies, but at the expense of other R&amp;D. A government has massive resources, but still limited. This lead to a world class space program.

So in a capitalist society. Companies are required to do their own R&amp;D. They don't have to subtract from the societies greater resources because a company is only limited to its own resources, so it essentially takes from itself. This doesn't allow the massive investment that the USSR was able to pour into a problem, but creates a slow creep across the entirety of society and creates cross overs that don't exist in a hyper specialised development. 

So the best example I can use is the development of Russian submarines. The US for most of the USSRs history didn't really concern them selves with the Russian subs because of how loud they were. They were confident that with the SOSIS (underwater microphone system) knew when subs had left ports and could find them easily with the Sonar. The Russians weren't able to machine better propellers because they lacked equlivant milling machines. These milling machines were developed by industries in an effort to gain competitive advantage, but they also contributed to advancements elsewhere that weren't considered when they were originally developed. The USSR had to steal the technology to be able create the subs of the later years that were again world class, but vastly more expensive to create from a resource stand point, again showing how they could produce amazing results in limited areas.

The people who seem to subscribe to the thinking that capitalism is worse at innovating don't want to acknowledge the slow creep of the entire societies advancement when compared to the very limited but extreme advances that socialism provided. They both have advantages from an innovation standpoint, but the extreme specialization that socialism provides doesn't allow for the externalities of the general technological advancement of a society.",,,1600464525,{},g5quocp,False,t3_ivdeua,False,False,t3_ivdeua,/r/Capitalism/comments/ivdeua/what_is_the_counter_argument_to_capitalism/g5quocp/,1600528877,1,True,False,Capitalism,t5_2qiyc,,0,[],[],text,t2_4ra4bzre,False,False,,,,

[],,RogueThief7,,,,,,[],"I understand what you're saying about *natural monopoly* and it's a good point, but it's imports to broaden your perspective.

Firstly, it's important to highlight that *natural monopoly* is an economic tendency and doesn't necessarily imply *true* monopoly, as in only one player.

The only way you can achieve true monopoly is through government lock down of the market. The closest you'll see in a free market is 99% monopoly, where other players are free to compete but simply can't deliver to capture a section of market. 

There are, however, alternatives to the infrastructure provided through so called *natural monopolies.* The example of water supply is a great one because there are a number of alternatives to mains water. Remember, water is that which literally falls from the sky.

The most obvious alternatives to mains water are rainwater catchment and well drilling. If you're lucky enough to live near a river or lake, you can literally draw water directly from there and treat as necessary. There are a number of alternatives to mains supply and these range in cost and viability depending on geographical features and availability of materials/decentralised infrastructure equipment to install wells/tanks/pipes/etc.

One may be inclined to argue that people wouldn't do that because water is so cheap and the upfront costs of individual, decentralised infrastructure are so absurdly high by comparison. I'd probably agree with that statement on face value but then on the other hand, we have already seen people pay the upfront costs of solar panels for a ROI that is 5-10 years or beyond.",,,1600479661,{},g5ro1zv,False,t3_iujwxk,False,True,t1_g5mxj4m,/r/Capitalism/comments/iujwxk/free_markets_rule_labor_competition_in_my_area/g5ro1zv/,1600545552,1,True,False,Capitalism,t5_2qiyc,,0,[],[],text,t2_gvenr,False,False,,,,

If the employees sign a contract agreeing to this, what's wrong with it? By your logic, should going to a dominatrix or partaking in BDSM be illegal too, as it's physical harm to their bodies?

If the employers just go around and physically assaulting their employees without consent, then it's an act of aggression and legally and morally indefensible. However, if employees agree to such treatment, while I do find it a bit strange, I don't think it should be legally punishable at all.

&gt;How about letting out bedrooms with no windows?

Why should this be illegal? Again, if you want a window in your bedroom, you can try and find a house with a window. It's not that complicated.

&gt;For Example tell me what of these transactions are voluntary and what are forced or manipulated:

1. A restaurants spikes their food with Opiods.

This one depends on the legality of distributing Opiods more than how aggressively the restaurant advertises.  I would even argue that more aggressive advertising of Opiods would target vulnerable populations and be seen as more predatory than otherwise.  If we assume it's legal to distribute Opiods in this situation, this is a voluntary transaction in the same way that utilizing caffeine without having ""a big sign"" saying you use caffeine would be.

&gt;Example two:  
&gt;  
&gt;5. A shop sells water.

Unequivocally voluntary.  You are free to do this now.  Any additional context here is just attempting to demonstrate a false need.  If it was profitable to set up market stalls in the middle of the desert and charge outrageous prices, it would be done and lead to competition.  This in turn would allow the market to set a fair price relative to the risk of setting up the shop vs. the market demand for water in the desert.

&gt;Example three:  
&gt;

Voluntary.  Additional context is just trying to paint the employer in a bad light.

When I say ""State,"" I mean things like national governments. It not only represent the collective, or the population of the society that is in support of itself (which is individuals of the collective supporting other individuals of the same collective), but it's also coercive to where it taxes the citizen of the society whether he's part of the collective present in society or not.

To own something is synonymous to have something and be able to control it. Theft, or stealing, is the taking of ones property without consent. If it wasn't already legitimately owned and you take it, it's not stealing because what was taken wasn't anyone else's property. I'm basing ownership of private property from Lockean principles.

And the means of production is basically how the things are manufactured and facilitated, what the environment is like for the worker.

So Socialism is a system where a national government has and controls the environment for the workers.

I'm sure, as we're on the same side here, that you know that this is still a terrible idea. There's evidence that shows that a state produces cars much worse than car companies. The state is only good at one thing, which is simply being a monopoly on arbitration, and to have it to expand over other industries or markets is a ridiculous idea.

Even if it was the case that a state can produce more and better cars than a car company, the worker environment would still be unfavorable to at least a minority of the society, which I'm still against because even if it is good, it isn't unanimous and therefore not consensual.

Capitalism was progressive at one point. It’s no longer that. It is now a regressive system holding humans back. Communism is likely a next step in human evolution. But this can only happen if the people who work the means of production own and control the means of production in a democratic way, not like the Soviet Union which was not worker run but party run. The workers did not control the party. There was no democracy. That was not what Marx wrote about or how he thought his theories would be implemented. People don’t usually get that part of what communism is. Communism is not state controlled economics it’s supposed to be the working class uniting to control the means of production so resources are allocated according to need not some invisible market where prices and value are arbitrary. 

I feel like Marx will have a greater and larger impact in human history. Adam smith will eventually be seen as a crazy white dude whose philosophy created empires of genocide, slavery and wage theft.

Eco grew up in Mussolini's Italy. Ur Facism is a very well respected essay among political historians. He lays out 14 primary features of fascism, saying that not every fascist regime has every feature, and the details will vary according to local culture, but that they all have many of them.

1. The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”
2. The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”
3. The cult of action for action’s sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”
4. Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”
5. Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”
6. Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”
7. The obsession with a plot. “The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.”
8. The enemy is both strong and weak. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”
9. Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”
10. Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”
11. Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.”
12. Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”
13. Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”
14. Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”

Fascism was progressive in that it grew out of economic frustration and general feelings of powerlessness, much like socialism. The rhetoric addresses real problems, but the solutions offered never worked and got lots of people killed.

Another example is a person that keeps getting into trouble because they know they don't need to deal with the consequences. They keep using drugs, over eating, smoking, etc. For sake of argument, each of these people is keeping to the moral standard of helping whenever anyone is in need, but their personal problems are causing them to be helped almost all of the time rather than any scenario. By your moral standard everyone can do what they may to legitimately avoid having to constantly help people. Otherwise, we'd have to make laws that no one is allowed any vice.

1. Unless you're an ancap, or to the extent that capitalsm involves or allows for government policy/interference, we have to factor in what the *government* portion of capitalism does, for good and for bad. Denmark and Sweden are capitalist, but they do far more than just leave people on their own to figure it out...in fact most capitalist nations have very generous welfare and transfers.

2. Governments in these same capitalist nations which help people stay more than just ""keeping their heads above water"", also do a ton to create most of the poverty in the first place (the u.s. is a poster-child of this with their drug war and corrupt and racist justice and policing systems), but also things like restricting immigration, restricting housing supply (zoning and building codes) and medical/doctor supply, etc...they make it so that there's a cost-of-living **cliff**, rather than a gradient down to homelessness (the metaphorical equivalent of drowning).  There are no cheap, legal options for housing, medical care, and many other services, in the u.s. and other capitalist countries.  There are only expensive options (you can argue that some of the licensing and regulation is ""necessary"", but that doesn't change the facts of what effect they have on prices and accessibility), there are no $20,000 shanties, or tiny sleeper pods, you can buy or rent in a high-productivity area.

This second thing is at the root of why so many young people today are enamored with socialism or at least disenchanted with capitalism: they have a very foreboding and insecure feeling, even when they have a decent job; they understand that, in most ways, even poor people in capitalism are better off than the average person in less capitalist societies...yet they still can't shake the feeling (understandably) of the high-risk game we're all having to play at the edge of this cost-of-living cliff (and how hyper-legalized our society has become where the average person commits 3 felonies a day, giving police or the state, pretext to imprison or fine you at any moment and making corporate policies mirror the same).

Where people go full-retard is in refusing to understand the source of this cliff, all these risky uncertainties...they blame it all on corporations and the rich (for capturing government) , when it is also the very policies they advocate and vote for, which have created the cliff, and have enabled and incentivized the rich to capture government so fully.",,,1592522415,{},fva77xa,False,t3_hbkoab,False,True,t1_fv9w0hz,/r/Capitalism/comments/hbkoab/tired_of_poverty_expand_capitalism/fva77xa/,1592524782,1,True,False,Capitalism,t5_2qiyc,,0,[],[],text,t2_8bujy,False,False,,,,

Name a country without some insane political opposition. As an American, I don't think the US has a place to talk about this, especially since the country is currently teetering on the brink of civil war while Finland on the other hand is one of the safest countries in the world, with the lowest number of police per capita of any European country, has the best education in the world, and receives the highest position in the [World Happiness Index](https://www.google.com/search?q=finland+happiness+index) nearly every single year.

I agree the education system in the US is a mess and it's a rather complex system to try and ""fix."" There is still the option to go to private schools which are much better run at a fraction of the budget and I think you can get a tax voucher/deduction for that (might be state dependent).

It is true that the nordic countries are more homogeneous than the US, and that can certainly make things easier when a majority of the country has the same social values and is pulling in the same direction.

To summarize, yes of course taxes are higher here.

Apart from that I don't disagree with anything in the article regarding numbers, and I can't find anything that fundamentally conflicts with what I've stated in my previous writings. I said I'm paying about 28% on an above-average income, and that's true, and the numbers you posted don't disagree with that. I stated that I recalled (from memory) that the highest tax bracket was about 55%, and I was 3% off. I stated that most people in the US believe everyone in the nordic countries is taxed at least 50%, and I said that's an over-exaggeration, which it is. So far nothing I've said conflicts with the numbers you've posted. 

I think you'll find that we actually agree on more things than we disagree on.

My version of it is that most people view competition as a matter of price, where two train lines compete, but in reality does it not offer the consumer more options to not simply compete with trains but rather with trucks, buses, planes, and more? If the cost of entry is too high in the train industry, start a trucking company and offer flexibility, don't just pigeonhole yourself into thinking in terms of trains.)

When I was around the age of thirteen or fourteen I got interested in Communism because it seemed like a great idea at the time. As I've gotten older (in my early 20's now), I've realized a few things. 

Foremost is that from studying economics, history, and political philosophy for the last decade of my life, I support Laissez-faire Capitalism more than any other economic system for a myriad of reasons. Albeit that I'm not the happiest with the American version of Capitalism.

But alongside that I eventually realized a large part of the reason my parents never had any money is that whatever they didn't pay in bills/taxes they would blow on going to restaurants, going to the movies, or other unnecessary things. In other words, they never saved any of their money. Don't get me wrong, I understand wanting to go for a night out every now and then, but they would always spend every last part of their pay checks and then just wait until the next one came to do it all over again. 

Whenever I tried to tell them that they should try and save their money for more important things like fixing up some things around our house and the like, they'd tell me that I didn't need to be concerned about things like the family finances. Which was always frustrating.

As a young adult now, I'm still in a bit of a rough spot. Again, coming from a poor family with no money or assets to fall back on. I'm also thousands of dollars in debt from student loans from when I was in college. However, I'm not at all bothered by it.

As for Fountainhead, I think it makes the point of capitalism rather well. Remember, capitalism is freedom, it is optionality, and other systems are the antithesis of it, in that they aim to control the person for some concept of a greater good that is usually anything but good in reality. 

The other important thing about the story is the character of Wynand and the tragedy that is his state. We've seen that very situation play out more than ever recently and we will see more of it to come. Hopefully the world goes the way his story ended and not with the one of Toohey's desire.

Cops don’t have money you dingus, they make less than I do. lol the average salary of a cop in the city I live in is lower than the median salary of the United States.

In capitalism, a government may nationalize an industry without suddenly becoming an oppressive communist regime. In fact, for the greater part of the 20th century, nationalized industries were a norm for most modern western bloc nations. 

The line between governments and private business is far less clear than the neoliberal wing of capitalism will have your believe. Wages are still dictated by market forces. If a government tells doctors they are only being paid minimum wage, they will just do something else... they’re not trapped or enslaved. More likely, they will organize and take collective action to force the taxpayer to pay more for their services. 

What WOULD make a government suddenly communist would be if all market activities came under a centralized authoritarian control. In this type of society, you would be forced to be a doctor and forced to take whatever wages you are offered. This is actually closer to feudalism, where a rigid structure pre-determines everyone’s role and any adaptation to external pressures normally requires change along generational timelines.  I suppose the innovation that communism brings to feudalism is that supposedly, a centralized group of experts help coordinate society into an efficient and adaptive machine. 

Finally, I simply have no baseline for what it would’ve been like to live in Soviet Russia during the mid 20th.... what would be the prime motivator to achieve? obviously, there were enough rocket scientists who were satisfied with how things were to put the first man into orbit.

Would America have been just as successful if a Communist revolution had occurred in the 1930’s? Would Vietnam have been worse off if US forces had held up against the communists?

Even the goal posts for “successful” are hard to establish. I do believe that the current world order has reduced extreme poverty on a global scale, decreased the chance of large scale conflict between the superpowers, and brought about incredible levels of innovation in many industries. These are successes, no doubt. Yet, we are also seeing frustration in the US with growing wealth inequality, decreasing labor standards, and societal polarization.

The electrified trains in the NEC are considerably more efficient than Amtrak's diesels and can feed energy captured from regenerative braking back to the electrical grid. Passenger rail is also very competitive with other modes in terms of safety per mile.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak#Efficiency

Compared to a car, it does appear to be ""super efficient"" for travelling to the same locations.

&gt;  ""We have the efficient portion,"" says Adie Tomer, a fellow at the Brookings one of the authors of ""A New Alignment: American Passenger Rail in an Era of Fiscal Constraint."" ""And then we have the geographically equitable portion of it.""

&gt; Taken together, the 26 of Amtrak’s 44 routes that run less than 400 miles had a positive operating balance in the 2011 Fiscal Year, with a surplus of $46 million. The 14 routes longer than 750 miles posted a loss of $597 million. The former account for 83 percent of ridership; the latter 15 percent.

&gt; What makes these routes successful? In part, as this interactive ridership-funding map makes clear, it’s because they fit a vision of passenger rail service as short, quick, intermodal transport. America’s 100 largest metros generate 88 percent of Amtrak’s ridership, though they make up only 65 percent of its population.

- https://amtrakoig.gov/sites/default/files/reports/EVALUATIONREPORT-92809.pdf

Interestingly enough, Amtrack operates at a loss by choice. They could easily just get rid of their non-profitable rails and make a killing but they subsidize them and operate at a loss to bring transportation to more remote locations and to check traffic overflow in urban centers.

Or, in other words, Amtrak isn't intended to necessarily run at a profit, but to maximize the transportation capabilities of citizens. I personally think that's fine if it offers more efficient robust transportation to citizens that need it to commute, but I think I can understand some of the reasons for why you may disagree.

It's really hard to move a lot of people around cheaply without operating at a loss, I hope you understand that. Just look at some of the private companies in the transportation industry. Say, Uber and Lyft, who barely break even.

Socialism has nothing to do with government distribution

&gt; Government redistribution in Venezuela and Cuba didn’t work out either. 

neither were ever socialist at any point.

do you have a proof for that claim

&gt; That’s what Bernie wants. 

what Bernie wants is education and health care for all and that's not even socialism

&gt; And what happened? The EXACT same thing that happens in EVERY socialist country.

name any country where the workers owning the means of production caused downfall.

 

&gt;It provides another form of voting.  
&gt;  
&gt;People can vote with their dollar.  
&gt;  
&gt;Women, before sufferage, could rally to avoid buying products or services that they felt were not worthy of existing.  
&gt;  
&gt;Today, we see the power of the consumer vote. When a company does something wrong like mistreating workers or scorching the Earth, we have the ability to vote with our dollars.  
&gt;  
&gt;Socialism removes that ability. It silences the individual.

I believe in voting with your dollar also and socialism would allow that to be a more democratic process because instead of a few millionaires only making decisions for profit the people can choose to not invest certain companies stock if they have bad practices.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You can argue about the effectiveness of the consumer vote just like you can argue whether a second amendment gun right could be effective against a tyrannical government. But in either case, you’d be missing the point.

you really overestimate the power of our class. if this was true you would think that Microsoft and Apple who employ child slaves to mine coltan and cobalt for their phones in congo wouldn't still exist. or amazon who treat their workers like absolute dogshit.socialism is all about empowering the individual did you even search google for what the word means.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A government that extends gun rights to its citizens is, by definition, not tyrannical.

socialism has nothing to do with guns I think and armed working class is a good idea and most socialists agree.

&gt;A government that empowers its citizens to “vote with their dollars” is, by definition, not tyrannical.

great we can have that government alongside a socialist economy

&gt;What socialists advocate for is based on pinning all the ills of society on the super wealthy. Socialists aren’t stupid. They know the government sucks. But the envy of the wealthy blinds them.

we don't

that's not an argument

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;They don’t see the number of people escaping poverty. They don’t see the decrease in food stamps and other handouts. All they see is Bezos and his billions. And that drives them to destroy all liberties so they can all live in a world where everyone has to eat the same rat meat for dinner.

it's funny because of practically all of the people who actually escaped poverty where in china. and no the world bank simply re-defined poverty from about $5 a day to about $2 giving the illusion of a mass increase in living standards.

what do the workers owning the means of production have to do with rats

Do you know anything about marxist-leninist them you would know that they view the state as a form of transition, but not all socialists are ML's- there's a whole section of socialism that's anarchistic that hates the idea of government transition. You've just single-handedly proven you don't know the basics of socialism.

I don’t care what socialists view the government as, the fact of the matter is that in order for their little utopia to exist, there has to be a government with a monopoly on violence in order to force everyone into line. I know plenty about socialism and unlike ideologues like yourself, I’m capable of looking passed the socialist’s rose tinted glasses and seeing that the utopia they describe is literally impossible without complete and total government control.

Let me ask you, if the government is intended to be a transition and it goes away after the “utopia” is reached, how will the utopia prevent people from deciding they want to work for themselves instead of the collective? 

The answer is, they can’t.

 
&gt;Smfh.... you're just baselessly repeating the same thing over again that's not the definition of socialism; socialism is worker control of the means of production which if you had actually read Marx and Engels and the various other types of socialists, you would realize that quickly.

I don’t give a rat’s ass about what your idealistic socialist nonsense says, I’m not talking about idealism here, I’m taking about reality. The utopia the socialists envision isn’t possible and anyone with an above room temperature IQ understands that. You can’t have everyone in line with a certain ideology without having some form of system to _force them_ to be in line with it. I’ve read Marx and Engels and as I’ve already said, it’s nothing more than idealistic nonsense that’s great in theory but literally impossible in practice.

&gt;Meanwhile you probably quote 1984 and Animal Farm because you forgot that George Orwell was a socialist.

Right, because it’s physically impossible for someone who supports and ideology to also realize its massive flaws.

You’re doing nothing more than proving my whole point that socialism is an ideology that _requires_ everyone to fall in line. You can possibly understand the concept of someone believing in something while also criticizing it. 

I’m a libertarian and I frequently criticize the flaws of libertarianism and I do that because a rational person who isn’t an insane ideologue doesn’t turn a blind eye to flaws in their beliefs.

Secondly, you are blatantly misrepresenting Orwell’s views here. Orwell was not a socialist and neither was he a capitalist. Orwell specifically wanted to combined the good aspects of both capitalism and socialism. He believed that both ideologies by themselves would lead to tyranny. You might want to [read up on your Orwell](https://www.civicsnation.org/2018/06/05/george-orwell-prefer-socialism-free-market-capitalism/) before acting like you actually know what he was about.

&gt;Very ironic considering the US is built on imperialism. The concept of Freedom requires context, freedom for who and in what capacity?

Ah yes, because the socialist countries never did any imperialism, did they? No, Russia and China merely invaded countries and _appropriated their resources for the good of re collective._ Clearly that’s completely different.

As for the context of freedom, in capitalist countries, you’re allowed to criticize the government. In socialists countries doing the same gets you at best thrown in jail and at worst put up against a wall.

In capitalist countries you have the freedom to decide what you do with you labor. If you want to reap the fruits of your labor, you’re free to do so. If you want to go live on a small hippie commune where everyone shares everything, you’re also free to do so. In socialist countries if you try and claim the fruits of your labor you are once again either thrown in jail or put up against the wall.

The very concept of socialism means that people lose their personal freedom, arguably the most important freedom of all. When you are required to use your labor to better the collective and have absolutely no say in the matter, you are not a free person, you are a slave.

&gt;Not a country, but rather a community that is come together to support each other (communism is stateless.... They not supposed to be based on countries);

Yes, and there in lies my entire point. Socialism function in communities where everyone agrees to it but you’re never going to get everyone to agree to in on a national or global scale.

I’m sorry but just because you want to violate someone else’s natural rights because you have the insane notion that you hold a claim to something that someone else worked for doesn’t mean you are allowed to do so.

&gt; I find this quite ironic. And like I said, many socialists are anarchists...  Like the one I linked to, but you for dismissed it because it doesn't use a monopoly on violence. Smh- the hypocrisy is silly.

You keep coming back to this completely worthless argument that “most socialists are anarchists.” I dismiss it because it’s just that, a worthless argument. There are many people that think they’re a fucking humanoid dog, that doesn’t it true. 

The fact of the matter is, and I’m getting rather sick of explaining this to you in hopes it will somehow get through your thick skull, is that socialism _as it is described in theory_ is physically impossible to implement on a large scale due to the fact that as soon as you get above the scale of a small commune you will inevitably have people who don’t agree with the socialist ideology, meaning you either have to let them do what they want and therefore ruin the socialist utopia or you have to use violence to force them into line. 

This is what has happened in _literally every instance where socialism was attempted._ The USSR, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zimbabwe. Literally every country that has attempted this crap has turned out _the exact same._

I dismissed you arguments about the small commune because that is once again irrelevant. As I already stated, socialism is perfectly plausible in a small community where everyone agrees with the ideology. But you keep ignoring it dismissing that because you can’t admit that if people were to disagree with the ideology they would need to be _forced_ to agree with it. 

&gt;Lmao... I'm a left-libertarian, and I have agreements and critiques of not only left libertarianism, but a variety of libertarian ideologies, unfortunately you are unable to see the diversity of thought within the liberty movement.

You are not a left libertarian. A left libertarian is someone who says “everyone else can do what they want, I’m going to go live on a commune with some other people.”

But that’s not what you’re stating here, you’re saying that socialism need to be implemented _on a national scale_ meaning that people won’t have the choice whether to go with it or not. 

The whole core tenant of libertarianism is the Non-Aggression Principle which essentially states thy everyone can do what they want so long as it does violate someone else’s rights. What you are proposing does not abide by the NAP because what you are proposing would take away people’s right to choose, thus violating their rights.

If you were actually a left libertarian you’d be more than happy to just go live on a commune, but you’re not. The very fact that you’re arguing that this needs to be implemented on a national or global scale shows that you are the _exact opposite_ of a libertarian. As I stated before, you can call yourself a dog all you want, that doesn’t magically make you one.

Alright, let’s shoot some holes through your cherry picked quotes with some other quotes, shall we?

 A review of _The Road to Serfdom_ Orwell wrote: “The first of them is an eloquent defence [sic] of laissez-faire capitalism, the other is an even more vehement denunciation of it. Each writer is convinced that the other’s policy leads directly to slavery, and the alarming thing is that they may both be right”

He also wrote: “Collectivism is not inherently democratic, but, on the contrary, gives to a tyrannical minority such powers as the Spanish Inquisitors never dreamed of.”

Another Orwell quote: “Capitalism leads to dole queues, the scramble for markets, and war. Collectivism leads to concentration camps, leader worship, and war.”

“There is no way out of [the problem of extremes of government] unless a planned economy can be somehow combined with the freedom of the intellect, which can only happen if the concept of right and wrong is returned to politics.”

All of these were in the article I linked that you clearly did not read. Orwell believed that both extremes of pure free-market capitalism and pure collectivism led to oppression, tyranny and war which perfectly lines up with my views. The extremes in any particular situation will always lead to oppression and suffering on a massive scale. 

A perfect and timely real world example of how extremes cause oppression and suffering is with disease outbreaks like the current Coronavirus outbreak. When a disease outbreak happens, you’ve got two extremes you call fall to. The first of these extremes is to just kill anyone who has or is believed to have the disease (pure collectivism). Sure this would stop the disease spreading and but it would result in hundreds of thousands of people having their rights violated by being slaughtered simply because they are believed to be sick. On the other extreme, you have doing absolutely nothing to the people who are infected (pure free-market capitalism). Sure it would protect their rights but it would also guarantee that the disease would spread like wildfire and cause untold suffering.

Neither of these choices are right, neither of these choices are moral. Instead, in order to be just and moral you need to find  something _in-between the two extremes_ which is exactly what both I believe and what Orwell believed.",,,1582061997,{},fi1p1pm,False,t3_f5cson,False,True,t1_fi1ggkc,/r/Capitalism/comments/f5cson/elizabeth_warren_says_shes_a_capitalist_to_my/fi1p1pm/,1582062924,1,True,False,Capitalism,t5_2qiyc,,0,,[],text,t2_2xwasoan,False,False,,,,

What they say next is that the workers should own the means of production. Well ok a valid point, someone else has already paid for the means of production so you think the workers should buy it from them? Which they are also perfectly free to do under capitalism.

Their answer is this: no we want to change the laws so that the workers owns the means of production.

Well then i will grant you that you have a point, but then who would actually buy the means of production if they dont own it after they bought it, and how many things do you buy for other people and just give it away, especially things that costs around $100,000 or more, why do you expect companies to do this while you arent doing just this?

Frankly, capitalism and socialism are absolutely not at odds with each other. You can have different systems of an economy that work better planned than free and vice-versa. 

For example: A lot of capitalists that think that healthcare would be better in a free market are super ignorant of the private restrictions on the markets, that have been set by the freest parts of those markets. the government is undeniably the best actor in most situations dealing with healthcare. Not only are “consumer” markets impossible to navigate, they are deliberately misleading and often require extensive training/education in many different fields. They cannot and will never have a free market. Deregulating here would be a crisis, and planning (to a point) is what has worked best for most places in the world. 

Small business and general consumer good/services for planned economies don’t really work because of the intense strain, extreme volatility, and small margins on most consumer goods and services. Bad tax policy can and will ruin businesses, but it’s incredibly difficult for a legislative body to effectively levy appropriate taxes on one group and or another (esp. at times of different levels of economic security), so it ends up being that small businesses end up getting fucked. 

Ultimately I think that leaders should be evaluating the positives and negatives of both systems, and build strategies that keep both in mind. It’s easy to say one works and the other doesn’t; it’s very difficult thing to admit that they both have very big positives and very big negatives. And I think that a lot of other moderates like me see that.

[],,EddieFender,,,,,,[],"So, since I got downvoted for pointing out that you very obviously are misrepresenting your opponents, let me break down why you’re a fucking moron and should delete reddit and maybe spend more time learning the valuable life skill of shutting your noise hole and listening to ideas with an open mind. 

1. Every socialist knows a business can be small. Everything you said is a gross misrepresentation and projecting your own ideas of what a small business vs big business dynamic is onto other people. Someone describing something that applies to both with a little nuance and you refusing to accept it because it throws your ideology into a tailspin. Reading more of your post made me realize this is your most disingenuous number on this list, but probably not the dumbest. 

2. This is your second most disingenuous. For one, socialists know that the 1% isn’t just billionaires and they know that billionaires’ assets aren’t all liquid. You kind of bring up the point that socialists make though, that their assets can be bought/sold. The amount of people paying themselves $50k is absolutely minuscule. Dividends count as income. More to the point, your giant estate with a tennis court or your warehouse of sports cars or your private jet etc etc. that aren’t liquid, are still very valid as targets for criticism. It’s not like it’s impossible for you to come up with more money to, say, fix the problems in Flint, or house the homeless in your city or something, just because your bank account only has $100,000. You can sell your shares in the hedge fund, or live in a normal sized house and only drive one luxury car and suddenly that liquid $100k becomes millions more. You could also reduce your personal holdings by doing the thing socialists are *actually* talking about, by giving them to the people you employ. **All** of the people you employ, even janitors and cashiers. 

3. Is mostly covered as part of 2, as they are related. To expand though, the concept of “risk” as you describe it is mostly a joke. If you own a business and I work for you, I face just as much risk, if not more, from you going out of business as you do. If I’m paycheck to paycheck and you have a bunch of assets to be liquidated when profits become to small or go negative, which one of us is gonna face eviction? Not to mention protections in the law for bankruptcy when it comes to asset protection. Plus, it’s a pretty common business practice to push aspects of risk into the employee (like the debate around minimum wage is basically business owners asking workers to subsidize their dream to own a business, rather than the business being expected to pay their employees fairly as a prerequisite of being open)

4. This is probably the dumbest. The tech inside of an iPhone is like 90% government funded R&amp;D. GPS, Internet, even touchscreens, are all government/state university tech that private companies then privatize, monetize, and profit from. Most very important and world changing stuff isn’t done in the private sector. It takes too long and is too expensive without the guaranteed profit. Private R&amp;D usually does stuff like make drug analogies that are mostly useless, or profit minor benefits/cost reductions. Nuclear power, the tech in smart phones, the internet, microprocessing, etc etc. 

5. This almost seems smart until you realize that part of the way taxes are received is from selling goods and services. If I had a giant throbbing brain like yours I’d go over to /r/socialism and make a post about how capitalists don’t understand that train tickets are a type of tax, but I’m not as smart as you I guess. 

6. This is the other front runner for dumbest. Mainly because you clearly had it explained using farms and factories, but you have no ability to extrapolate it to another form of business and unless someone goes through an exhaustive list of possible ways to exploit a worker you won’t accept it. To explain the start up being paid by outside funds... those funds are still income, ultimately. Assuming the business ever turns a profit, that profit is the way you measure extracted wealth. While it’s hard to determine individual effort, it isn’t hard to conceptualize models. If someone who owns a company makes a profit off a product they aren’t producing, they are exploiting someone else’s labor. Total revenue - labor - other costs - labor of the owner = exploited labor. The problem is, capitalists will consider “labor of the owner” as some potentially infinite number because people like Bezos or Musk are literal gods among men capable of producing thousands of times as many goods or services as a normal human.

I’m not gonna debate you. I’ve done already that for 2 days. These are what I believe to be the non-obvious overall mentalities of socialists that I’ve gathered by debating, asking questions, and hours of lurking on their comments and posts. Go read my comment history if you’d like, because most of the points you make here I’ve addressed and asked questions about. Nobody could give straight answers after rebuttals, it’s just the same regurgitated cookie cutter bullshit.

From this post I’ve gathered that you think you’re a socialist, but you’re not. Or you don’t realize you keep contradicting yourself. But since you can’t get over the fact that you’re smart and I’m dumb, I’ll ask you some questions, maybe you can clarify.

1-3. Ok so a business can be small right? You’re taking the same level of risk as me working with me right? What assets can I liquidate if I’m running a small ecommerce gig out of my dad’s garage? Where’s my tennis court when I go under? What skills do I have if I wanna get a job? Nobody wants to hire someone who can only start a business yet alone a failed one, ask any entrepreneur what “unemployable” means. In fact it’s a running joke. What about you, what are your skills? Are they transferable to a business similar to mine? 

This is what I mean. You say businesses can be small, but your ideas and mentalities contradict each other. You guys think every business was started by either high net worth individuals, or are corporations with management who have those types of perks. You can’t fathom that something started from nothing. That some dude bought a pair of shoes with a little money, made $5 by flipping it and repeated it millions of times until he’s built Zappos and sold to Amazon for a billion dollars. In your mind every business is already established even if you know isn’t, it’s what you think subconsciously.

5. Who’s selling the goods and services if there are no private companies? Workers own the means of production right? If the labor theory of value was true, and the output value is being taxed, wouldn’t that be a profit? Doesn’t that mean that the government is taking advantage of workers? 

In your train example, if tickets are the products and they pay for the operation, what’s the incentive to improve the operation if there’s no profit? The workers would get paid less as the operation improves right? If the government taxes the output value, what’s their incentive to improve the train? They would want to keep train tickets high to collect more tax would they not? 

Hmm I wonder what cheaper, riding a government train (that’s actually partially privatized) or flying using a private airline company?

6. Again, extrapolated examples are what I’ve brought up, and I get the same regurgitated responses that makes no sense outside of anything with a measurable output, which are manufacturing and farming. Maybe some basic services.

If I manufacture a product and we determine the value of it from the labor of workers, how is that same product valued as it moves across the supply chain? What are workers paid as the supply chain improves? Does their salary decrease? If so what’s the incentive to improve the supply chain?

So tech organizations can start with outside funds right? You agree that these organizations can put a value on output until they turn a profit, right? I’m guessing in your world these outside funds come from the government? What incentive does the government have to foster and grow tech companies if there’s no return value? How can they create value in let’s say an advertisement model? There’s no value exchange because the value of both the platform and the advertisers are owned the workers.",,,1582084310,{},fi2nypy,True,t3_f5ypbt,False,True,t1_fi2e3wh,/r/Capitalism/comments/f5ypbt/i_spent_two_days_of_my_life_trying_to_debate/fi2nypy/,1582084311,1,True,False,Capitalism,t5_2qiyc,,0,,[],text,t2_aqh2u,False,True,,,,

[],,Gretshus,,,,,,[],"This is a good question. The answer is rather open ended with no truly satisfying answer, but I'll try to give some ideas to think about.

First of all, Capitalism is to blame for climate change in one sense. That sense is that the industrial revolution and its subsequent technological revolution were enabled by Capitalism. Without it, we'd still live like we did in the 1500s. The progress that humanity has had came at the long term cost of putting CO2 into the air. However, it should be noted that Capitalism itself did not put the CO2 into the air directly, but as a side effect of the use of high carbon emitting, inefficient fuel sources that we were limited to during the Industrial revolution. This is important because when assessing fault, you can do so in a technical manner (meaning, A caused B, which caused C, therefore A led to C) or you can do so in a single fault manner (meaning, A caused B, which caused C, therefore we should address the relationship between B and C). Using the logic of the former, one could say that Capitalism is to blame for climate change. 

However, Capitalism does not necessitate high carbon emitting fuel sources. Western nations (which we can say are the most Capitalist nations generally) have had the largest carbon emission reductions of any country in the world. America, in particular, had the largest absolute reduction in net carbon emissions of any country in the world. This is due to the overall shift from coal to natural gas in energy production, which releases far less CO2. This is key, CO2 is a waste product. More waste means lower resource efficiency. Lower resource efficiency is not ideal for Capitalism. Capitalism also incentivizes technological advancement, which makes energy production even more efficient over time as it lowers the required resources (and thus CO2 emissions) for producing a set amount of energy. Further, carbon based fuels are limited in nature (except for bio-fuel, aka wood burning, but that's a bit more carbon neutral because of tree farms), which means that their cost will theoretically increase over time (more and more are being discovered, but that doesn't exactly change that they're limited). Sustainable fuel sources (such as solar and wind farms) are increasing in efficiency as they're having their turn of technological breakthroughs, which means their cost effectiveness will increase, which means more carbon based energy will theoretically be replaced by carbon neutral energy sources. To put it short, Capitalism will reduce carbon emissions over time. This has been shown with Capitalist countries as the amount of carbon they emit has only decreased. Modern climate change escalation is actually caused by India and China (and Russia if you use the CO2 emitted per 1000$ spent metric) as they're the only groups that are increasing CO2 emissions (and are doing so at a blistering rate).

The Socialism part is rather iffy. See, what Socialism would do is effectively give absolute control of the economy to the state (or collective, both have the same vice). Absolute power over the economy means that it would ride or die based on the decisions of the individuals in power (or the dictator if we're talking about what's likely based on history). It comes down to a question: how likely is it that the group (or individual) in power in a Socialist nation will make decisions that will reduce their carbon footprint sufficiently while also not reducing the standard of living of its nation beyond what's acceptable in the process? That sort of knowledge requires an understanding of every industry, beyond ideas like solar and wind power. You'd have to understand every market inside and out as you'd need to know how a shortage in one would affect the others. People don't have that sort of knowledge or intelligence. We're inherently limited in our capacity to think, and this is assuming the best of intentions. The possibility of corruption, embezzlement, or just a sadistic pursuit of absolute power by starving the masses are all possible (likely if we were to look at the other Socialist nations). Then there's the problem that choosing Socialism means you can't choose Capitalism. You lose the benefit that Capitalism provides (improved carbon efficiency over time, which results in lower effects of climate change over time). Socialist nations can't just invest in technology and get the same sort of improvements that Capitalism gets. Money from the state isn't expected to have a financial return, money from private investors IS expected to have a financial return ASAP, else they'll take their money elsewhere. In other words, the incentives that the Socialist model possesses does not encourage greener technology, it instead incentivizes technological stagnation as the money is not tied to financial return but is instead just given (also you can't profit off of an invention due to intellectual property being government owned, which further reduces incentive for R&amp;D). Socialism would only work if ALL the technology required for a fully green tech society were invented AND if the person in power either gets super lucky or is a super genius who is able to run an economy in a dynamic global market for longer than a few years.",,,1579527762,{},ff2xi73,False,t3_eq855q,False,True,t3_eq855q,/r/Capitalism/comments/eq855q/is_capitalism_to_blame_for_climate_change_and/ff2xi73/,1579527763,1,True,False,Capitalism,t5_2qiyc,,0,,[],text,t2_wtb0x26,False,False,,,,[]

Your argument keeps taking random directions and you keep painting my arguments as something they are not.

Specifically, your claim that I am ""assigning"" IQ is not found anywhere in my premises above. Low skilled jobs are best suited for those with low IQ. That doesn't mean that high IQ individuals cannot perform these jobs. I never once said something like ""all menial jobs are done by low IQ people"". It just so happens that high IQ individuals tend to be in positions of leadership, high salary, and power throughout all fields. We know this from social research from the 20th century and beyond. 

I'm going to stop replying to you because this isn't a productive discussion. You are supposed to attack my premises. Instead, you are creating fake arguments and accusing me of claims I am not making. 

And your last statement that ""The capacity to earn millions depends on who you got born to."" is simply nonsensical. The reason for that is because it is a broad generalization that doesn't account for anything besides societal position or genetic influence. There are nearly an infinite number of factors that contributes to whether or not somebody has the capacity to earn money. IQ is definitely one of them. We know this from publications such as ""The Bell Curve"" by Charles Murray and many other social researchers. Here is a Quora article that explains it fairly well and summaries the research if you'd like to read more.

I come from the social sciences department at a top university in the US and I can promise you that the clear consensus in the field of psychology is that IQ is a valid measure of intelligence. You are entitled to your own opinion about their validity, but the top experts in the field of clinical psychology agree that it is valid. 

""IQ is influenced by environmental factors provided to those born to money""
Yes, but it is also partly due to genetics. The field of clinical psychology also agrees universally that IQ is partly genetic regardless of environmental influence.

&gt;Take for example the case of a hundred 100-unit apartment buildings worth a total of $2B in a large west coast city. The margins on rental buildings are extremely slim. Counting maintenance, it is around 2-3%.

LVT is no property tax. The fact that the totally worth of the apartment buildings is $2B is non consequencual. LVT is only levied on what's called ""the unimproved value of land"".

&gt;Currently the owners collectively pay around $8M a year in income tax. If they sell, they pay capital gains tax. There is no room to expand the taxes because rent control limits the income produced.

You only highlight problems with capital gains tax and rent control, rather than anything wrong with LVT. And as CGT is a tax that isn't LVT, the article opposes its existence. 

And even if the LVT would be implemented into the current system to replace property taxes, it merely means that the owners would pay taxes only for the value of the land they own, without any buildings on them.

&gt;People who say that they advocate for economic meltdown in their own country because they want other people to pay more taxes lose all credibility.

Where did you get the idea that I or the article advocate more taxation? The article clearly says it's a case for LVT to replace all other kinds of taxes. Even in the most Fringe case I presented, it merely replaced property tax.

This also makes this entire next section nonsensical: 

&gt;If you levy a LVT, where will the money come from to pay the tax? The owners cannot build higher because the tenants are protected against eviction for new construction. 

&gt;The owners would collectively go bankrupt. The banks hold the notes on those buildings so would foreclose. But they would not be able to sell the buildings for their value because of the LVT. So they would face a loss of $100M's.

&gt;That situation is for less than 1% of the housing stock, so total bank losses could reach hundreds of billions of dollars. Typically the next step is either foreign bailout (Russia buys up all land for cents on the dollar) or government bail out.

* The money to pay for the LTV is the same money that's now paid in other forms of taxes (most probably less, unless you're holding vacant land or using your land really inefficiently)

&gt;The point of income taxes vs asset taxes is to tax the event where liquidity occurs. It is efficient and fair. 

What's the proper expression here? ""You've just activated my trap card!""?

In 1879 Henry George wrote *progress and poverty*, basically the Bible for LVT advocates. Wasn't the first to think of it, but he truly formulated the arguments for it.

The main point of the book, is that LVT is both fair and efficient (and as a minor point, talks about why other taxes aren't). 
While other taxes create deadweight, LVT doesn't, since the supply of land is constant, therefore it is efficient. 

As for fair, all taxes except for the LVT (both income and asset taxes) are inherently not ""fair"" if you accept the idea of property rights. The argument for LTV being fair is that land isn't the result of anyone's labor, which is already a far better claim for it being a just tax.

&gt;Asset taxes can force the sale of illiquid assets which a) puts small owners out of business, and b) concentrates wealth in large corporations who have the capital to withstand bad policy.

Forcing the same of illiquid assets is, to an extent, the idea. It's sometimes the proper result for the capture of economic rent. ""Everybody works but the vacant lot"". 

The main complaint of small business owners as far as I know (tell me if I'm wrong) is about income taxes, either in the form of a sales tax or VAT, or personal income taxes in pass-through businesses.

As for monopolies, I believe it was Bastiat who formulated the proof that a monopoly cannot be created in a free market. Combined with George's proof that LVT creates no deadweight, and only captures economic rent, there's no basis for fearing a monopoly on land ownership anymore than you do right now.

The Rural Electrification Act of 1936, enacted on May 20, 1936, provided federal loans for the installation of electrical distribution systems to serve isolated rural areas of the United States.

The funding was channeled through cooperative electric power companies, most of which still exist today.  These member-owned cooperatives purchased power on a wholesale basis and distributed it using their own network of transmission and distribution lines. The Rural Electrification Act was also an attempt made by FDR's New Deal to deal with high unemployment.
